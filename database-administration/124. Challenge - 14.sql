Subject: Help Creating 2 New Users

Hi there…
Hoping you could help us out with one more thing. I would like to create two new Users who can access our database…
* User: DataGuru, *DBA-level privileges*, Password: ChangeMe!
* User: Analyst, *SELECT only privileges*, Password: ChangeMe!

Thank you!!
\- Joe
